Below is a `README.md` file tailored for your network monitoring system based on the details you've shared. It reflects your current implementation (Vert.x framework, PostgreSQL database, ZeroMQ server for communication, and a Go-based Linux plugin engine) and outlines features like credential management, discovery, provisioning, and polling data. I've also included placeholders for future expansions (Windows and SNMP devices).

# Network Monitoring System

Welcome to the **Network Monitoring System**, a robust solution designed to monitor network devices efficiently. This system leverages modern technologies to provide real-time insights into device performance and status. Currently, it supports monitoring Linux devices, with plans to extend support to Windows devices and SNMP-enabled devices in the future.

## Overview

The system is built with a modular architecture, integrating the following core components:
- **Vert.x Framework**: A reactive toolkit for building scalable, event-driven applications in Java.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A reliable, open-source relational database for storing monitoring data and device configurations.
- **ZeroMQ (ZMQ)**: A high-performance messaging library facilitating communication between the Java-based core system and the Go-based plugin engine.
- **Go-based Linux Plugin Engine**: A lightweight, efficient engine written in Go to handle Linux device monitoring tasks.

## Features

### 1. Credential Management
- **Purpose**: Securely manage credentials for accessing monitored devices.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Device credentials (username, password) are stored in PostgreSQL with encryption (future enhancement).
  - Passed securely via JSON payloads to the Go plugin engine through ZeroMQ.
- **Usage**: Credentials are included in requests for discovery and polling operations.

### 2. Device Discovery
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect and identify Linux devices on the network.
- **Implementation**:
  - The Go plugin engine performs discovery using SSH (via host, port, username, and password).
  - Returns discovery status (`success` or `failed`) and a status message.
- **Request Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "pluginEngine": "linux",
    "eventName": "discovery",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 22
  }
  ```
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "statusMsg": "Device discovered"
  }
  ```

### 3. Device Provisioning
- **Purpose**: Register and configure devices in the system for monitoring.
- **Implementation**:
  - Devices discovered are stored in PostgreSQL with details like device ID, host, port, and credentials.
  - Managed via Vert.x event bus messages to initiate provisioning workflows.
- **Future Enhancement**: Automate provisioning after discovery with user approval.

### 4. Polling Data
- **Purpose**: Collect performance metrics from monitored Linux devices.
- **Implementation**:
  - The Go plugin engine uses SSH to gather metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage) from Linux devices.
  - Data is sent back as a JSON string and stored in PostgreSQL tables (`linuxCounterResult` and `pollerResult`).
- **Request Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "pluginEngine": "linux",
    "eventName": "polling",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 22
  }
  ```
- **Response Format** (example):
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "statusMsg": "Data collected",
    "metrics": [
      {"name": "cpu_usage", "value": "25%"},
      {"name": "memory_usage", "value": "1.2GB"}
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Storage**:
  - Metrics are saved in `linuxCounterResult` (counter data) and linked to `pollerResult` (device-specific results) in PostgreSQL.

### Communication
- **ZeroMQ Server**:
  - Uses a ROUTER socket to receive requests from the Java client and a DEALER socket internally (via `inproc`) for processing.
  - Ensures asynchronous, non-blocking communication with the Go plugin engine.
- **Client-Server Interaction**:
  - Java client (Vert.x) sends multi-part messages `[empty, payload]` to the ROUTER socket.
  - Responses are routed back to the client based on its identity.

## Architecture

   |                         |                                |                             |

```

- **Vert.x Client**: Handles user requests, sends messages via ZeroMQ, and stores data in PostgreSQL.
- **ZMQ Server**: Acts as a proxy between the client and plugin engine.
- **Go Plugin Engine**: Processes discovery and polling tasks for Linux devices.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores device configurations and monitoring data.

## Current Support
- **Linux Devices**: Fully supported with SSH-based monitoring.
  - Discovery: Detects reachable Linux devices.
  - Polling: Collects system metrics.

## Future Enhancements
- **Windows Devices**: Add support for monitoring via WMI or PowerShell.
- **SNMP Devices**: Integrate SNMP protocol for network equipment monitoring.
- **Enhanced Security**: Encrypt stored credentials and add authentication for ZMQ communication.
- **UI Dashboard**: Develop a web interface for visualizing metrics and managing devices.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 11+ (for Vert.x)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- Go 1.18+ (for the plugin engine)
- PostgreSQL 13+
- ZeroMQ library (installed for Go: `go get github.com/pebbe/zmq4`)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd network-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Create a database: `CREATE DATABASE network_monitoring;`
   - Create tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE linux_counter_result (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         cpu_usage VARCHAR(50),
         memory_usage VARCHAR(50)
     );
     CREATE TABLE poller_result (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         counter_id INT REFERENCES linux_counter_result(id),
         monitor_device_id VARCHAR(50),
         counter_type VARCHAR(50)
     );
     ```

3. **Build the Go Plugin Engine**:
   ```bash
   cd src/server
   go build -o linux-plugin-engine
   ```

4. **Run the ZMQ Server**:
   ```bash
   ./linux-plugin-engine
   ```
   - Default address: `tcp://*:5555`

5. **Build and Run the Vert.x Application**:
   ```bash
   cd java-client
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/network-monitoring-1.0.0.jar
   ```

### Configuration
- **Server Address**: Update `SERVER_ADDRESS` in the Java client (`tcp://127.0.0.1:5555` by default).
- **Database**: Configure PostgreSQL connection details in the Vert.x application (e.g., via `application.conf`).

## Usage
1. **Send a Polling Request**:
   - Use the Vert.x event bus to trigger polling:
     ```java
     vertx.eventBus().request("polling.address", devicesJsonArray, reply -> {
         if (reply.succeeded()) {
             System.out.println("Polling completed: " + reply.result().body());
         }
     });
     ```

2. **View Logs**:
   - Check server logs for request/response details.
   - Check Vert.x logs for database operations.

### Notes:
- **Assumptions**: I assumed typical metric names (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`) for the polling response. Adjust these based on what `linux.CollectLinuxData` actually returns.
- **Future Features**: Mentioned Windows and SNMP support as planned expansions, which you can flesh out later.
- **Database Schema**: Provided a basic schema; enhance it with additional fields (e.g., timestamps) as needed.

Let me know if you want to refine any section or add more specific details about your project!
