# NMSLite

**NMSLite** is a lightweight Network Management System (NMS) designed to discover and monitor network devices such as Linux, Windows, and SNMP-enabled devices. Built with Vert.x and PostgreSQL, it provides an efficient, event-driven solution for collecting and storing system metrics like CPU usage, memory, disk, and network statistics.

## Overview
NMSLite aims to simplify network device monitoring by offering device discovery, metrics collection, and storage in a scalable architecture. It leverages Vert.x for asynchronous operations and PostgreSQL for persistent storage, making it suitable for small to medium-sized networks.

### Key Features
- **Device Discovery**: Identifies devices (Linux, Windows, SNMP) using IP, port, and credentials via SSH or SNMP.
- **Metrics Collection**: Gathers detailed system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage, network stats).
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on Vert.x, enabling high-performance, non-blocking operations.
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Stores device information, credentials, and metrics in a structured database.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for device discovery and management.

### Technologies Used
- **Vert.x**: For asynchronous, event-driven processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data persistence.
- **Java**: Main programming language (Vert.x 4.x, Java 11+).

### Project Structure
- **Verticles**:
  - `SenderVerticle`: Handles REST API requests and sends discovery tasks via the event bus.
  - `ConsumerVerticle`: Processes discovery tasks, collects metrics, and saves results to the database.
- **Database Schema**:
  - `credential`: Stores device credentials.
  - `monitored_device`: Stores discovered device information.
  - `linux_counter_result`, `windows_counter_result`, `snmp_device_counter_result`: Stores metrics for respective device types.
  - `poller_result`: Maps devices to their metrics.
- **QueryHandler**: A utility class for generalized CRUD operations on PostgreSQL tables.

### How It Works
1. **Discovery**: The REST API triggers device discovery by sending IP, port, and credential details to the event bus.
2. **Metrics Collection**: Verticles process discovery tasks, collect metrics via SSH/SNMP, and store results in PostgreSQL.
3. **Storage**: Metrics are saved in type-specific tables (`linux_counter_result`, etc.) and linked to devices via `poller_result`.
